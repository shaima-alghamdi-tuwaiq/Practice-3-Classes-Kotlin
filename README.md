# Practice-3-Classes-Kotlin

### Summary
- Call the random() function on an IntRange to generate a random number: (1..6).random()
- Classes are like a blueprint of an object. They can have properties and behaviors, implemented as variables and functions.
- An instance of a class represents an object, often a physical object, such as a dice. You can call the actions on the object and change its attributes.
- You can supply values to a class when you create an instance. For example: class Dice(val numSides: Int) and then create an instance with Dice(6).
- Functions can return something. Specify the data type to be returned in the function definition, and use a return statement in the function body to return something. For example: fun example(): Int { return 5 }
